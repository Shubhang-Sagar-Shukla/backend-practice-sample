// cors is basically used to allow cross-origin requests as browser will block request if it is not from the same webpage
/*  üí° Analogy:

Imagine your backend is a club.

CORS = bouncer at the door asking: ‚ÄúWho are you? Are you allowed in?‚Äù

cors() = giving a list of allowed guests (origins) so the bouncer lets them in.*/
